# IoT-Water-Quality-Monitoring
💧 IoT Water Quality Monitoring System
Tech Stack: ESP32, TDS Sensor, EasyEDA, Arduino IDE, ThingSpeak, Custom PCB Fabrication
• Engineered a real-time IoT-based water quality monitoring system using ESP32 and a TDS sensor to measure total dissolved solids, enabling accurate detection of water purity levels.
• Designed a custom copper-clad PCB using EasyEDA and implemented the etching process manually, achieving compact hardware integration for reliable field deployment.
• Configured wireless data transmission to ThingSpeak for real-time visualization and analysis through interactive dashboards.
